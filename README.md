# The Runcher
***Rusted Launcher*** (Runcher) is a mod launcher for Total War games since empire, built on top of Rusted PackFile Manager's backend. Compared to other launchers, it features:
* ***Mod Profiles***
* ***Mod Categorization*** inspired by Mod Organizer 2.
* ***Support for all games supported by RPFM*** (except Arena).

Note that Runcher is currently under heavy development, so that list may be incomplete.

# FAQ
- **How can I translate it to my own language?**: go to the locale folder, copy the *English_en.ftl* file, rename it to *NameYouWantInTheUI_xx.ftl*. For example, for spanish it'll be *Espa√±ol_es.ftl*. Translate it. Done.
- **Why there is no .exe in the download?**: because you downloaded the source code, not the program. Check at the begining of this description, where is says ***Downloads here***.
