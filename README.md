***Rusted Launcher*** (Runcher) is a mod launcher for Total War games since empire, built on top of Rusted PackFile Manager's backend. Compared to other launchers, it features:
* ***Mod Profiles***, including autolaunch options for selected profiles to go from desktop to game in one click.
* ***Mod Categorization***, inspired by Mod Organizer 2.
* ***Advanced launch options***, like unit multiplier, skip intros, enable logging,...
* ***Workshop integration***, so you can upload your own mods from Runcher, or force-download mods to ensure they're up to date.
* ***Secondary folder and game-locking support***, so if a patch comes out and you want to finish your campaign, you can set it up so neither the game nor the mods update.
* ***Support for all games supported by RPFM*** (except Arena).

# FAQ
- **How can I translate it to my own language?**: go to the locale folder, copy the *English_en.ftl* file, rename it to *NameYouWantInTheUI_xx.ftl*. For example, for spanish it'll be *Espa√±ol_es.ftl*. Translate it. Done.
- **Why there is no .exe in the download?**: because you downloaded the source code, not the program. Check at the begining of this description, where is says ***Downloads here***.
