# The Workshopper

This exe contains the integration with the SteamWorks API. This requires Steam to be running, and when used Steam will show you as playing the game you're using this exe for.

For compilation, you need a copy of the steam_api64.lib or steam_api64.dll (this one is only needed at runtime if you compiled this program without the .lib file). That file comes from the SteamWorks SDK.
