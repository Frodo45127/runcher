# The Bouncer

This is just a small exe to replace the game's launcher in Shogun 2, so we can actually launch the game without the game failing to initialize the SteamWorks API and failing to detect what dlcs you have.

This may should be ported to call the SteamWorks API directly in a future update (so we don't need to overwrite the vanilla launcher with it).
